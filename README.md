# AI-Discord-Chatbot

A chatbot for Discord that uses artificial intelligence for engaging conversation. This project was a fun way for me to learn about the NeuralIntents package and become more familiar with web sockets and requests.

## Outdated Notice
Please note that a Discord update has affected the way tokens are handled, therefore the bot is now outdated. I am no longer working on this project, but feel free to create a pull request if you would like to continue development.

## How To Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install the required packages
3. Populate the `tokens.txt` file with your Discord token(s)
4. (Optional) Rewrite the intents file to train the AI model to your liking

## What I Used and What It Did For The Project
- Python Requests: Used to send HTTP requests to Discord's API in order to perform actions such as sending and receiving messages
- JSON: Used to encode and decode data that was sent and received in the HTTP requests
- Websockets: Used to establish a persistent connection between the chatbot and Discord, allowing for real-time communication
- NeuralIntents: Used to train the chatbot's AI model and allow it to understand and respond to different conversation styles and topics

## Intent Behind The Project
The intent behind this project was to create a chatbot that could hold interesting and engaging conversations with users on Discord. By implementing artificial intelligence and the NeuralIntents package, the chatbot was able to learn and adapt to different conversation styles and topics.

I also wanted to learn more about web sockets and requests, and this project provided a great opportunity to do so.

Although the bot is now outdated due to a Discord update, I hope that this project can still serve as a useful learning resource for others who are interested in chatbots and AI.
