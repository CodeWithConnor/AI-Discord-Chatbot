## AI-Discord-Chatbot
A chatbot for Discord which implements artificial intelligence to create interesting conversations.

Please note: A Discord update has affected the way tokens are handled, therefore the bot is now outdated. I am no longer working on this project, but feel free to create a pull request!

### How To Run

Clone the repo, install the required packages, populate the tokens.txt file with your Discord token(s) and optionally re-write the intents file so the AI model will be trained to your liking.

### About The Project

This project was a really fun way for me to become familiar with the NeuralIntents package, whilst also learning more about web sockets/requests.

### What I Learnt From This Project

- Training AI models
- Python Requests
- JSON
- Websockets
